# Step 1: Business Understanding

### Background

#### Dream Housing Finance Company is a leading provider of home loans, with a wide presence across urban, semi-urban, and rural areas. The company aims to provide seamless and efficient loan services to its customers, who first apply for home loans, followed by a thorough eligibility validation process conducted by the company.

### Objective

#### The primary objective is to automate the loan eligibility process in real-time. This automation will be based on customer details provided during the online application process. The key features for determining loan eligibility include Gender, Marital Status, Education, Number of Dependents, Income, Loan Amount, Credit History, and other relevant details.

### Business Goals

* Efficiency Improvement: Automating the loan eligibility process will significantly reduce the time required to assess applications, improving the overall customer experience.
* Scalability: The automated system will allow the company to handle a larger volume of loan applications without a proportional increase in manual processing efforts.
* Accuracy: By leveraging machine learning algorithms, the company aims to enhance the accuracy of loan eligibility decisions, thereby reducing the risk of approving ineligible applicants.
* Cost Reduction: Automating the eligibility process will reduce operational costs associated with manual processing and validation of loan applications.

### Success Criteria

* Reduction in Processing Time: The system should reduce the time taken to process loan applications by at least 50%.
* Accuracy Rate: The machine learning model should achieve an accuracy rate of at least 85% in predicting loan eligibility.
* Customer Satisfaction: Improvement in customer satisfaction scores due to faster and more reliable loan eligibility decisions.
* Operational Cost Savings: Measurable reduction in operational costs related to loan application processing.
