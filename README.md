# Step 1: Business Understanding

### Background

#### Dream Housing Finance Company is a leading provider of home loans with a wide presence across urban, semi-urban, and rural areas. Customers first apply for home loans, and the company then validates their eligibility. The company aims to improve its loan eligibility process by leveraging machine learning algorithms.

### Determine Business Objectives

#### The primary objective is to automate the loan eligibility process in real-time based on customer details provided during the online application. The business success criteria include:

* Efficiency Improvement: Automate the eligibility process to reduce processing time by at least 50%.
* Scalability: Enable the company to handle a larger volume of loan applications efficiently.
* Accuracy: Achieve an accuracy rate of at least 85% in predicting loan eligibility.
* Cost Reduction: Reduce operational costs associated with manual processing.
* Customer Satisfaction: Improve customer satisfaction scores through faster and more reliable eligibility decisions.

### Assess Situation

* Resources Availability: The company has access to historical loan application data, including customer details and loan approval status.
* Project Requirements: The project requires data preprocessing, feature selection, model training, and validation. It also involves integration with the existing application system for real-time processing.
* Risks and Contingencies: Potential risks include data quality issues, model overfitting or underfitting, and integration challenges with the current system. Contingency plans involve rigorous data cleaning, regular model evaluation, and phased integration.
* Cost-Benefit Analysis: The benefits of automating the loan eligibility process include significant time savings, reduced operational costs, improved accuracy, and enhanced customer satisfaction. These benefits outweigh the initial costs of developing and implementing the machine learning model.

### Determine Data Mining Goals

#### From a technical perspective, the data mining goals include:

* Data Collection and Preparation: Gather and preprocess historical loan application data.
* Feature Engineering: Identify and create relevant features such as Gender, Marital Status, Education, Number of Dependents, Income, Loan Amount, and Credit History.
* Model Training and Evaluation: Train multiple supervised classification algorithms and evaluate their performance to select the best model.
* Real-Time Prediction: Develop a system for real-time loan eligibility prediction based on the selected model.

### Produce Project Plan

#### Technology and Tools Selection: Use R for data processing and machine learning, and Shiny for integrating the model with the online application system.
Detailed Project Phases:
* Data Collection and Preprocessing: Collect data, handle missing values, and preprocess for modeling.
* Feature Engineering: Create and select relevant features.
* Model Training and Evaluation: Train and evaluate various machine learning models using R.
* Model Integration: Integrate the chosen model with the existing system for real-time prediction using Shiny.
* Deployment and Monitoring: Deploy the system and monitor its performance regularly.
